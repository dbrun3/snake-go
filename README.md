# snake.go
### A snake.io inspired game for the terminal

This is game I started working on to learn Go and CI/CD Actions for a new job.

By default the game is in client mode, where you will be prompted to connect to a
server (which I have kept private for obvious reasons) but you can play local games 
with the flag --mode host, where other players will connect to your game game, 
or setup a dedicated server (no graphics) with --mode server.

In practice, never copy/paste commands from github into the terminalðŸ˜­ 
But here are some commands that hopefully make installing the lastest version 
of the game an easier process. I've only verified the mac one works right now, 
post an issue if you have any problems with the other platforms.

After installing, run in the terminal with `snake-go`
